            I am a soon to be father looking for a change in career where I can
            be there for my family without missing too many life events. I
            currently work in a fine dining restaurant as a server. I graduated
            college with a Hotel Restaurant Management Degree and it is time for
            a change.

            I love to travel and try hole in the wall restaurants. I also ask
            locals for recommendations on where they would go to eat. I'm all
            for being a tourist and trying out popular places, but I also love
            putting myself in the local's shoes. I once went to San Francisco on
            Spring Break to visit some friends. I was on a very tight budget.
            One of my classmates dragged us on our first night to Hard Rock
            Cafe, a pretty well known chain and kind of new to me. We had a bad
            experience and I spent half of my budget on the first night. The
            rest of the trip I had to ration out my money and find cheap and
            good restaurants to eat at. I discovered Ike's sandwiches and El
            Favarito. Both delicious and iconic spots to eat in San Francisco.
            On a different occasion, I was visiting my cousin in New York where
            he took me to an underground restaurant that served hot dogs and the
            next room was a bar with a game room. I honestly would have never
            found it myself. Since then, I've made it a point ask the locals
            where they would go to eat. That lead to a very fun night.

            I am originally from Los Angeles, California. I lived in New York
            and San Francisco in my past. I've visited many states in the east
            coast and have many more states on my bucket list. I've traveled
            recently to Thailand, Laos, China and Japan. I've definitely been
            bit by the travel bug. I would love to go to South America next. You
            learn so much from traveling. You learn so much about people you
            travel with and people you meet. Theres a whole world out there, why
            not check it out. You only live once right?
